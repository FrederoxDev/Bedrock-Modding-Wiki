# Introduction

This guide is being re-written within the context of Minecraft 1.20.51.1, and will be based around [AmethystAPI](https://github.com/FrederoxDev/Amethyst). As opposed to the old guide which was based around Minecraft 1.14.60.5 which was based around Zenova.

The guide is still actively being worked on and is currently incomplete. When completed it will have more information about using amethyst and being able to reverse engineer using IDA Pro.
